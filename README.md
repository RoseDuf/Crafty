# Crafty

Unity version: 2019.4.0f1

## Rules:

* If you want to test something new in a scene, create a new scene with your name. Ideally, each one of us should have our own scenes to work on.

* If you want to develop or experiment with a new feature (that being shaders, models, scenes, textures, etc.), add it to the "Sandbox" folder.

* Create a new branch everytime you will add something new!

* If you aren't comfortable merging your branch into master or are having problems merging, please ask for help before doing anything crazy.
